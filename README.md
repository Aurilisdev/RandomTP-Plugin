Are you tired of having to walk hundreds or thousands of blocks to get to the perfect base spot. With this plugin you can teleport to a random location anywhere in your world using a simple config and one command.
Notable information:

Instead of having to type /randomteleport every time you can use any of these aliases: /rtp, /rteleport, /randomtp, /tpr, /teleportrandom and /tprandom.

For a player to be able to use this command they need the permission: 'randomtp.command'
